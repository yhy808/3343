This package is running with the NEURON simulation program written by Michael
Hines and available on internet at:
  http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  http://neuron.duke.edu/

The package contains mechanisms (.mod files) and programs (.oc files) needed 
to simulate interconnected thalamocortical (TC) and thalamic reticular (RE) 
cells, relative to the paper:

  Ionic mechanisms underlying synchronized oscillations and propagating
  waves in a model of ferret thalamic slices. Journal of Neurophysiology
  76: 2049-2070, 1996.

  MECHANISMS
  ==========

 HH2.mod		: fast sodium spikes (Na and K currents)
 IT.mod			: T-current for TC cell
 IT2.mod		: T-current for RE cell (different kinetics and v-dep)
 Ih.mod			: h-current for TC cell, including upregulation
			  by intracellular calcium
 cadecay.mod		: intracellular calcium dynamics
 kleak.mod		: leak K+ current (TC cell)

 ampa.mod		: AMPA-mediated synaptic currents
 gabaa.mod		: GABA_A-mediated synaptic currents
 gabab.mod		: GABA_B-mediated synaptic currents


  HOW TO RUN
  ==========

Use autolaunch on modeldb or:

unix platform:

To compile the demo, NEURON and INTERVIEWS must be installed and working on
the machine you are using.  Just type "nrnivmodl" to compile the mechanisms
given in the mod files.

Then, execute the main demo program by typing:

  nrngui mosinit.hoc

mswin platform:

  Compile the mechanism (mod) files by using mknrndll.  Then start the simulation
  by clicking on mosinit.hoc in windows explorer.

back to any platform:

Once the menu and graphics interface has appeared, select a simulation from the
"Simulations of thalamic oscillations" window.  Then click on "Init and Run"
button to start the simulation...

7/11/2005 Additional modifications to restart by first closing other simulation
windows and also updating README contact information.

2/14/2001 Michael Hines trivially modified some of the hoc files
to use the more flexible load_file in place of certain xopen statements,
ensure that the current version of the standard gui library comes
up first, and arrange graphs on the screen.

Not yet:
He also updated the mod files to be compatible with cvode and
make use of internal compuations of ionic reversal potential. This
version is quantitatively identical to the original.

10-2007: AD, better synaptic mechanisms using counters; added delta
oscillations.
